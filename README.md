This project has been in progress for a month since January 2015.

In addition to basic SNS functions, there are two differentiating functions for the purpose of privacy protection.

### 1.'Just Like'

Likes you marked are not visible to others. It is a function that displays purely appreciation for posts.

### 2.'Atti'

'Atti' is a Korean word meaning a true friend.

It is a function for SNS users to focus on a one-to-one relationship rather than a large number of relationships.

The more posts, comments, and likes between each other, the higher the likelihood, and when the intimacy level reaches the maximum, it becomes between'Atti'.

### 3.'Search similar image posts'
You can search posts with similar images. You can find a posts with an image similar to the place you went to and the food you ate.
